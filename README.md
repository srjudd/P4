<p>The following strategies were used with index.html to optimize page loading.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Replacing the pizzeria with a thumbnail and optimizing profile pic, and using them both as gifs.</li>
	<li>The external style.css style sheet was removed. Most of the css needed for the page was in-lined; some style sheet elements, such as the link styles, were moved into a style declaration in the head.</li>
	<li>Javascript in the head was made asynchronous except for a Google Analytics script that Google recommended not to make async.</li>
	<li>A script at the end of the html page was used to load the Google font stylesheet.</li>
</ul>
